🎓 College Events Archive
Welcome to my College Events repository! This space serves as a portfolio of the technical symposiums, hackathons, and interactive challenges I developed and organized during my B.E. in Computer Science.

My goal has always been to elevate standard college events by building custom, high-quality technical platforms that test participants' fundamental CS knowledge in unique ways.

What you will find in this repository:

Interactive Event Platforms: Custom web applications built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS (such as simulated OS environments for treasure hunts).

Technical Leadership: Architecting and executing events for major technical symposiums like Gyan Mitra '26.

Project Archives: Source code, rulesets, and documentation for various campus tech challenges.
